# Patient Q&A Chatbot

## Project Overview
This project is a medical Question & Answer chatbot designed to assist patients by providing accurate, safe, and context-aware answers to medical questions. It leverages a large, curated dataset of medical FAQs (MedQuAD) and combines advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using OpenAI language models to deliver reliable, source-cited responses. The chatbot prioritizes patient safety and aims to answer questions only within the bounds of trusted information.
